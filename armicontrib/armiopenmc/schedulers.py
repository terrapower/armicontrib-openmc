Code that schedules OpenMC executions during ARMI cases.

This module contains the :py:class:`OpenMCInterface` class, which integrates OpenMC runs
into ARMI runs using the ARMI :py:class:`~armi.interfaces.Interface` API.  The
:py:class:`OpenMCInterface` is implemented on top of the :py:class:`OpenMCCoreEvaluation`
class, which handles the actual task of running OpenMC. This separation between
scheduling the OpenMC analysis and performing the analysis aids in code re-use and
flexibility; rather than binding the process of running OpenMC analysis to the Interface
interaction hooks, the ``OpenMCCoreEvaluation`` can be used as a standard MPI action in
custom scripts, or be driven directly by a reactivity coefficients interface, for
instance.
