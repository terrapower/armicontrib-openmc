Define OpenMC-specific ARMI user-configurable settings.

This module implements the :py:meth:`ArmiPlugin.defineSettings()
<armi:armi.plugins.ArmiPlugin.defineSettings()>` and
:py:meth:`ArmiPlugin.defineSettingsValidators()
<armi:armi.plugins.ArmiPlugin.defineSettingsValidators()>` Plugin APIs. Aside from the
settings that control OpenMC's behavior specifically, this provides new options to the
ARMI built-in ``neutronicsKernel`` setting:

    * "OpenMC": Enable OpenMC.
